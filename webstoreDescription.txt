Technical details for nerds

***** How It Works *****
To save bandwidth, the extension sets video quality to the lowest available using YouTube's player API and hides the video. This doesn't affect audio quality—YouTube handles audio separately and streams it in optimal quality. The extension doesn't interfere with YouTube's data stream and doesn't block ads, so you can support content creators as usual.

***** Why Not Simply Disable the Video Stream? *****
YouTube's architecture doesn't allow completely disabling the video stream while keeping audio active—the media streams are bundled together. Attempting to disable video might:

• Interrupt audio playback
• Cause player errors or unexpected behavior
• Violate YouTube's terms of service
• Break compatibility with different devices/browsers

Setting video quality to the lowest available provides the best balance of bandwidth savings, audio quality preservation, and system stability.
