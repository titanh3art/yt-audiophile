# YouTube Audiophile

A Chrome extension that lets you enjoy YouTube videos as audio-only, saving bandwidth while you listen to music or podcasts.

## Features

- Listen to YouTube content without watching videos
- Reduces data usage by playing in lowest quality
- Easy toggle switch next to the YouTube logo
- Quick keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+A)
- Remembers your preference across sessions

## Usage

- Use the toggle switch to switch between audio-only and video modes
- Press Ctrl+Shift+A for quick toggling
- Your setting is saved automatically

## How It Works

To save bandwidth, the extension sets video quality to the lowest available and hides the video using YouTube's player API. It doesn't interfere with YouTube's data stream or audio quality — YouTube handles all that. It also doesn't block ads.
