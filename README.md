# YouTube Audiophile

A Chrome extension that lets you enjoy YouTube videos as audio-only, saving bandwidth while you listen to music or podcasts.

## Features

- Listen to YouTube content without watching videos
- Reduces data usage by playing in lowest quality
- Easy toggle switch next to the YouTube logo
- Quick keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+A)
- Remembers your preference across sessions

## Usage

- Use the toggle switch to switch between audio-only and video modes
- Press Ctrl+Shift+A for quick toggling
- Your setting is saved automatically

## How It Works

To save bandwidth, the extension sets video quality to the lowest available using YouTube's player API and hides the video. This doesn't affect audio quality—YouTube handles audio separately and streams it in optimal quality. The extension doesn't interfere with YouTube's data stream and doesn't block ads, so you can support content creators as usual.
