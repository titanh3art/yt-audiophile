# YouTube Audiophile

A Chrome extension that lets you enjoy YouTube videos as audio-only, saving bandwidth while you listen to music or podcasts, and perfect for workplaces where you want to only listen without visuals. ♫⋆｡♪

## Features

- Listen to YouTube content without watching videos
- Hides the video from view and plays in lowest quality in the background to save bandwidth
- Automatically hides video thumbnails by replacing them with solid black background for a distraction-free experience
- Thumbnails on newly loaded content (via scrolling) are hidden once loading completes
- Easy toggle switch next to the YouTube logo
- Quick keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+A)
- Remembers your preference across sessions

## Usage

- Use the toggle switch next to the YouTube logo to enable/disable audio-only mode
- When enabled, the video is hidden, thumbnails are replaced with colors, and video quality is set to the lowest to save bandwidth
- New thumbnails loaded while scrolling are automatically hidden once loading completes
- Press Ctrl+Shift+A for quick toggling
- Your setting is saved automatically and persists across sessions

## How It Works

To save bandwidth, the extension sets video quality to the lowest available using YouTube's player API and hides the video. This doesn't affect audio quality—YouTube handles audio separately and streams it in optimal quality. The extension doesn't interfere with YouTube's data stream and doesn't block ads, so you can support content creators as usual.
