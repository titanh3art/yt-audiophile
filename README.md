# YouTube Audiophile

A Chrome extension that lets you enjoy YouTube videos as audio-only, saving bandwidth while you listen to music or podcasts, and perfect for workplaces where you want to only listen without visuals. ♫⋆｡♪

## Features

- Listen to YouTube content without watching videos
- Hides the video from view and plays in lowest quality in the background to save bandwidth
- Easy toggle switch next to the YouTube logo
- Quick keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+A)
- Remembers your preference across sessions

## Usage

- Use the toggle switch to switch between audio-only and video modes
- Press Ctrl+Shift+A for quick toggling
- Your setting is saved automatically

## How It Works

To save bandwidth, the extension sets video quality to the lowest available using YouTube's player API and hides the video. This doesn't affect audio quality—YouTube handles audio separately and streams it in optimal quality. The extension doesn't interfere with YouTube's data stream and doesn't block ads, so you can support content creators as usual.
